CP1404 Practical Reflection
What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I’ve started planning my programs before coding instead of jumping straight in. I also commit more frequently with clear messages, which helps me keep track of changes and avoid mistakes.

What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I need to manage my time better and not leave practicals to the last minute. I also want to spend more time reviewing my own code for readability and efficiency before submitting.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I’m following the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and writing cleaner, more modular code. I also make use of Git and GitHub properly with branches and pull requests.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to stop relying too much on examples and try to solve problems independently first. I should also test my programs more thoroughly before submission.

What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
It would be great to have more real-world project examples or optional mini-projects to apply what we’ve learned in practicals. They would help connect the weekly topics to professional programming.
